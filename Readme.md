# Tessalations
This project is a cute little program that loads up a random image and draws triangles over it. It is meant to be nothing more than a simple screen saver like application.

# Future work
## Break classes into their own files

## Squash Bug where triangles will draw real big
Probably an edge case where a pixel is considered not in a triangle that it actually is in.

## Reduce load time on init or cover it up with a loading symbol
