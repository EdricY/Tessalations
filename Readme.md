# Tessallations
This project is a cute little program that loads up a random image and draws triangles over it. It is meant to be nothing more than a simple screen saver like application.

# To Run
Navigate to https://jbernard3396.github.io/Tessalations/ in Google Chrome (It WILL NOT run in most other browsers)

The page will take a few seconds to load

# Future Work
## Break classes into their own files

## Squash Bug where triangles will draw real big
Probably an edge case where a pixel is considered not in a triangle that it actually is in.

## Reduce load time on init or cover it up with a loading symbol
